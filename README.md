This is my Assignment/Task Manager project that I built using Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. It's a desktop application designed to help users manage their tasks and assignments in a simple but effective way. 
Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks they no longer need, giving them full control over their task management.

One of the key features I implemented is a complete user authentication system where people can create their own accounts and log in to access their personal tasks. 
This means each user gets their own personalized experience with the application, and their data stays separate from other users. All the user information, including usernames, 
passwords, and their individual tasks, gets stored in JSON files so everything persists even when the application is closed. My custom data manger helped me be successful in this aspect of the project

From a technical standpoint, I used the singleton design pattern to manage the core functionality of the application. This really helped me when I was trying to integrate my Java backend code with the JavaFX 
frontend interface.  I also created my own custom data manager that handles loading and saving all the user information to JSON files with proper organization and key structures.
Working on this project taught me a lot about application development from start to finish. I started by testing everything through the terminal to make sure my core logic worked, 
then moved on to building the actual UI design. This process really helped me understand what it takes to create a functional application that people can actually use. 
One of the biggest learning experiences was figuring out how to use CSS with JavaFX to style the interface. I spent a lot of time working on the visual design and color schemes to make sure the 
application looked professional and wasn't just bland or boring to use. Overall, this project showed me what it's really like to develop a complete desktop application, 
and it was an amazing experience putting all these different technologies together to create something functional and have visual aspects.
